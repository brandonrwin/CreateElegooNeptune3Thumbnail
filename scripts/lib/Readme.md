Library Installation
""""""""""""""""""""

I don't know how the image encoding works, so the Elegoo provided libraries are used.

These libraries come from Elegoo Cura, found at: https://www.elegoo.com/pages/3d-printing-user-support

Within the `Cura/plugins/MKS Plugin` folder you will find:
    - ColPic_X64.dll: Windows
    - libColPic.dylib: macOS
    - libColPic.so: Linux

I did not provide the libraries in this repo, because I don't know what the licensing is, and I don't know what's in them.

Place the libraries (or the one for your OS) into this folder!

macOS Instructions
""""""""""""""""""

macOS will quarantine the libColPic.dylib file. You need to right click, then "Open", then hit the "Open" button (where nothing will happen), to
allow its use.
